# Schemas

Above, it was said briefly about schemas; In general, each schema includes:

pure, inrelation, outrelation, embedded and struct, which is enclosed in two types, dynamic and static, and is included in another object called service. By default, the service object has the main key. And by adding other microservices, other keys will be added to it.

We have used the superstruct library to create a pure structure in each schema; As a result, these values can be used for each field:
